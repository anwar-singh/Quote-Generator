## Inspirational Quote Generator

A simple web‑based Inspirational Quote Generator built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. When the user clicks the “Get Inspired” button, the app randomly selects and displays a motivational quote from a predefined list.

### Features

- Clean landing page with a centred quote card and motivational heading.  
- “Get Inspired” button that shows a new random quote each time it is clicked.  
- All quotes are stored in a JavaScript array, so the app works fully in the browser with no backend.

### Tech Stack

- HTML for the basic page structure and quote container.  
- CSS for styling the background, quote card and button.  
- JavaScript for storing the quotes and randomly selecting one to display.  

### How It Works

- The page loads with either a default quote or an empty card.  
- A quotes array in script.js contains multiple motivational quote strings.  
- When the user clicks “Get Inspired”, JavaScript picks a random index from the array and updates the quote text inside the card.  

### Project Structure

- index.html or main.html – Main page with the quote card and “Get Inspired” button.  
- styles.css – Styles for the background gradient, card and button.  
- script.js – Contains the quotes array and the logic to select and render a random quote.  

### Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the HTML file in any modern web browser.  
3. Click “Get Inspired” to generate a new random quote.  

### What I Learned

- Creating a simple interactive UI with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
